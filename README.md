Warm Bench website

## Developement information

You need to have `node` and `npm` installed on your operating system to
be able to develop on that repository. Once they are installed,
launch `npm install` to install the dependencies.

You can launch one of these commands depending on what you want to do:
- `npm run build` to simply build the website (the build is in the `build`
  folder).
- `npm run start` compiles the assets (`Sass` and `JavaScript`) and
  then watches for changes in these latter. Everything is recompiled
  and the browser page is reloaded automatically at every modification.
  _Use this command if you want to develop_.
